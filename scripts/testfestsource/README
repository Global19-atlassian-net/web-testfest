These are the scripts that extract tests from SVN, run them and display the results. They expect 
a specific directory structure.

testfestroot
     /phpBuildDir (create in advance)
     /svnCheckOutDir (this will be created the first time you run  testfesthourly.php)
     /testRunDir (create this AND subdirectories in advance, use make_test_directories.sh).
        /php5.2
        /php5.3
        /php6.0

Then modify teh code to set the $rootDir

The web site is:
http://testfest.php.net/displayresults.php

1) There is a PHP script to extract and build PHP once a day.
/home/zoe/testfestsource/src/testfestdaily.php

Currently fails to build a working PHP 6 but is OK for the others. This is not in cron yet.

2) Script to update SVN, copy the phpt files out to run directoris, run them against 52, 53 and 6.
/home/zoe/testfestsource/src/testfesthourly.php

Runs once an hour. See /etc/cron.hourly to set it up. (/sbin/service crond status|stop|start).

3) shell script to publish the results
/home/zoe/testfestsource/src/publishresults.sh

Runs once an hour AFTER above.

4) Three files need to be copied to in /var/www/html
displayresults.php, viewcontents.php, failedfilelist.php

5) The results are published in /var/www/html/publishresults which also needs to be created in advance
